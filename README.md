# Spin
Welcome to Spin, the social media platform based on forums!

Spin allows users to view and make posts on a dynamic timeline. 

This project was the result of my own personal interest in full-stack development. I used Django's web framework to set up the back end and also set up SQL databases to hold user information like usernames, emails, passwords, and their posts. I used html, css, and bootstrap to make the site aesthetically pleasing. 

Although this social media platform is not deployed [ I am a broke college student :( ], feel free to download these files (along with any necessary packages to make it run) and create your own account, test accounts, and try all of the functions demonstrated in the video. 

Thanks!
